6-DOF Stewart Platform with Link Mechanism Legs

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dynamixel connection is using pypot. You can build or install through pip:
```
  pip install pypot
```

Numpy may also be requied for some of the functions

V1.0 -- from September, 2015

v1.0 design and prototyping of a 6-DOF Stewart platform with link-mechanism (fixed-rotatory) legs. 

Video demo:  https://youtu.be/hVesXkTAK0Q

A sample of using Newton-Raphson method for forward kinematics and another samle of using Monte-Carlo method for accuracy analysis are included.

OFWTP -- from March, 2016

The irregular ocean wave modeling with Stewart platform based on JONSWAP Ocean Spctrum is developed and implemented on wind tunnel tests with offshore floating wind turbine platform at Control and Energy Systems Center (CESC) at Case Western Reserve University.
