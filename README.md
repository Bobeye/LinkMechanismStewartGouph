6-DOF Stewart Platform with Link Mechanism Legs

#####################################################
V1.0 -- from September, 2015

v1.0 design and prototyping of a 6-DOF Stewart platform with link-mechanism (fixed-rotatory) legs. 

Video demo:  https://youtu.be/hVesXkTAK0Q

Origin prototype is using Dynamixel AX-12A, servo control is refered from: https://github.com/poppy-project/pypot

A sample of using Newton-Raphson method for forward kinematics and another samle of using Monte-Carlo method for accuracy analysis are included.
